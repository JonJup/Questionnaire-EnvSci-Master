	This questionnaire is specifically designed for students of the environmental sciences masters program at the university of Koblenz-Landau. It is not designed for a specific stage in that program so some of the questions might not be answerable by you at this time. The aim of this survey is to find the strength and weaknesses of the program so that they might be improved upon. To this end it is important that you answer the questions faithfully. Comment-boxes below each question allow you to elaborate on your answer. This might be appropriate if the quality of the lectures in one module is strongly differing or if you want to explain a particularly good or bad evaluation score. Written out answers are very valuable to us, as they allow you to explicitly state your matter, so please be sure to use them as frequently as you can.
